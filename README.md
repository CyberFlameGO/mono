Martian Mono is a monospaced typeface family consisting of a variable font and 28 styles: Condensed to Wide, Thin to Extra Bold. It’s not a neutral font, but despite this, it remains suitable for reading. Overhanging terminals, a closed aperture, and an almost complete lack of contrast lead to slightly brutal and assertive aesthetics.

The typeface features a tall x-height, and it has vertical metrics which guarantee equal space is present above the cap height and under the baseline. The latter makes this typeface an on-screen workhorse: it is evenly placed on buttons, inputs, lists, and forms. When coupled together, all the above features make Martian Mono a reasonable choice for any user interface design.

Prefer otf file format for macOS, and ttf for Windows.

## Font size and legibility

Originally designed for the screen, the glyph height stick to the pixel grid on commonly used font sizes. In addition, it comes equipped with OpenType and TrueType hinting, and Martian Mono appears legible on most platforms, even when being rendered in small sizes.

For the best results use next pairs of size / line height:

* 7.5 / 10 (or 14, 18) px
* 10 / 12 (or 16, 20) px
* 12.5 / 14 (or 18, 22) px
* 15 / 20 (or 24, 28) px
etc.
